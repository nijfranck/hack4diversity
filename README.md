Interview Sync is a peer to peer based interview prep platform for internship/full-time applicants looking to get more realistic practice for technical interviews. Interviews are held over google hangout sessions, and we use a coin-based reward system: if you interview someone, you gain a coin, if you get interviewed, you lose a coin.
